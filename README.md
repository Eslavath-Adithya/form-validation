This project is a registration form with a visually appealing design. 
It features a centered form on a full-page background image related to security (key and lock). 
The form includes fields for Full Name, Email ID, Phone Number, Password, and Confirm Password, with built-in validation for each field. 
The form provides real-time error feedback and uses a semi-transparent background to ensure text readability against the background image. 
The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for layout, styling, and validation.
